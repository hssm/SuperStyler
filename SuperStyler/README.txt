SuperStyler is an experimental Anki2 plugin to allow stylesheet editing of Anki decks on multiple devices simultaneously from within Anki Desktop.

Dev notes:
styleSelector.ui needs to be compiled with pyuic4, but the output is already included in the project, so there's no need to do that unless you modify the .ui file.
