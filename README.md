#SuperStyler

SuperStyler is an add-on for [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) which allows you to edit a note type's stylesheet from the desktop client while previewing the changes on multiple other devices at the same time.

[Here is a YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-nN6KMO3Cw) demonstrating the add-on.

## Purpose
This add-on was created in response to the frustration of creating suitable stylesheets for my mobile devices; making small changes, syncing the deck on both ends, and then realising the changes weren't what you needed, is nettlesome. After doing it a hundred times, this add-on mysteriously materialized for the good of compulsive stylesheetists everywhere. It also helps to create better cross-platform stylesheets for those who intend to widely distribute their decks.

Template editing is not (yet!) supported. CSS only.

### Running the add-on from this directory

maindialog.ui needs to be compiled with pyuic4, but the output (maindialog.py) is already included in the project, so there's no need to do that unless you modify the .ui file.
