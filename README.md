SuperStyler is an Anki 2 plugin that allows stylesheet editing of Anki notes on multiple devices simultaneously from within Anki Desktop.

Dev notes:
maindialog.ui needs to be compiled with pyuic4, but the output (maindialog.py) is already included in the project, so there's no need to do that unless you modify the .ui file.
